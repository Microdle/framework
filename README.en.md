PHP micro framework for middleware

Microdle is a PHP micro framework to facilitate the creation of APIs as part of a middleware architecture. Its name "Microdle" comes from the words "micro" (micro framework) and "middle" (middleware).

Although in an experimental version, this micro framework presents a concentration of functionalities. It is easy to use, is made for rapid development, and is performance oriented. Like its big brother Adventy, it is inspired by the AOP paradigm to ensure that it has clear, elegant, and reusable code. The development of unit tests then becomes simpler, thus facilitating non-regression.

This micro framework favors KISS more than SOLID and PSR. The programming of its DNA violates certain good practices or design patterns, but it is in order to offer a simple, fast and efficient tool.

The sources are available on GitHub since Sunday, March 07th 2021. The preparation of a tutorial for the use of this micro framework is in progress.
Thank you in advance for your patience.
